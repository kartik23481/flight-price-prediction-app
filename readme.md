# AeroPrice Insight ‚úàÔ∏èüí∞

This project provides an end-to-end solution for predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning. It features a complete pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (XGBoost), and a user-friendly interactive web application built with Streamlit.

The application not only predicts the price for a given flight configuration but also provides several actionable insights to help users find the best deals by exploring trade-offs like airline choice, departure time, travel dates, number of stops, and departure city.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Accurate Price Prediction:** Enter flight details (airline, route, date, time, stops, duration) and get an instant price prediction.
* **Deal-o-Meter Gauge:** Instantly see if the predicted price is a "Great Deal," "Good Deal," "Average," or "Expensive" compared to historical prices for that specific route (if available).
* **Airline Comparison:** View predicted prices for the *same journey* across all available airlines, highlighting the user's selected airline.
* **Deeper Insights (via Tabs):**
    * **Price by Time:** See how the price changes for morning, afternoon, evening, or night departures.
    * **Flexible Dates:** Explore price trends using a line chart for a few days before and after your selected date.
    * **Price by Stops:** Compare the cost of non-stop vs. 1-stop or 2-stop flights for the same route and airline.
    * **Flexible Sources:** Check prices for flying *to* your chosen destination *from* different origin cities on the same day.
    * **Prediction Context:** Validate the prediction against historical data:
        * View similar flights on the *same route*, filterable by month.
        * View similar flights based on *duration* across *any route*.
* **Price Breakdown (SHAP Waterfall Plot):** Understand *why* the price is what it is by seeing how each feature contributed positively or negatively, starting from the average price.
* **Global Model Insights (SHAP Summary Plot):** See which factors (like duration, airline, stops) matter most for flight prices *overall*, demonstrating the model's logic.

## üöÄ Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kartik23481/flight-price-prediction-app.git](https://github.com/kartik23481/flight-price-prediction-app.git)
    cd flight-price-prediction-app
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r freezed_new_flight_venv_requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Ensure Data and Artifacts:**
    Make sure the training data file (`data/train_data.csv`) and the saved model/transformer (`artifacts/`) are present in the correct locations.

5.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application should open automatically in your web browser.

## üìà Model Performance

The XGBoost regression model achieves an **R¬≤ score of approximately 86%** on the validation set, indicating a reasonably good fit for predicting flight prices based on the available features and data size (approx. 6000 rows).

## üîÆ Future Improvements

* Modify the original model training script to correctly implement `get_feature_names_out` for custom transformers in the Scikit-learn pipeline. Re-save the `column_transformer.joblib` to enable user-friendly feature names in SHAP plots.
* Implement a complete **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up automated testing (e.g., using GitHub Actions) and continuous deployment to a cloud platform.
* Integrate an **Interactive AI Chatbot:** Add an agentic AI chatbot (using Microsoft Autogen Framework) that allows users to ask natural language questions about the training data, generating insights and visualizations on the fly. ü§ñüìä
* Deploy the Streamlit app to a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud, Heroku, AWS) for public access.
* Incorporate more recent or a larger dataset for potentially improved model accuracy and robustness.
* Experiment with alternative regression models (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) or further hyperparameter tuning.
* Add enhanced error handling for invalid user inputs (e.g., duration incompatible with stops, impossible routes).
